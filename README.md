# VE-Preset-Purple

![Example Screenshot](Mod/thumb.png)

This is my preset with a dark sky box containing purple nebula, modified environment lighting and custom sun rays and flares.

If you do not like the Skybox or you do not want modified sun rays, check out the collection above. It includes  Skybox, Sun and Environment as seperate mods. They can be combined so that you can build your Skybox to your liking.

**This Sky Box does not contain a Speed Mod.**

## Features

* Dark skybox with purple nebula in 4K
